The topics covered in the provided code snippet include:

1. Object-oriented programming (OOP): The code involves defining classes (Item and Cart) with attributes and methods. OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism may be discussed or utilized.

2. Method invocation and parameter passing: The code demonstrates passing parameters to methods, both by value (sillyCheckout method) and by reference (Checkout method). This illustrates the concepts of pass by value and pass by reference.

3. Static methods: The demo method in the Item class is declared as static, indicating it belongs to the class itself rather than any specific instance of the class.

4. Data encapsulation: The Cart class encapsulates its data members (myCash, myTotal, myChange) and provides methods to manipulate them.

5. String representation: The toString method is overridden to provide a custom string representation of the Cart object state.

6. Problem-solving and algorithmic thinking: The code implements logic for shopping, calculating change, and generating itemized receipts, requiring problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.


/**
 * Item class
 *
 * Go shopping with a single $20 bill.
 * 1. Create an Item class, with a static demo method. Inside the demo method:
 *
 * 2. Use the Item class to create objects for the shopping items.
 * 3. Check out and pay for all items with your cash and calculate your change.
 * 4. Show Itemized receipt on the console including the total and your correct change.
 * 5. Create a Cart class with the following data members:
 *      private int myCash
 *      private int myTotal
 *      private int myChange
 *
 * 6. Create the following methods in the Cart class:
 *
 *      public void sillyCheckout(double cash, double price, double total, double change);
 *      to show PASS BY VALUE:
 *      call sillyCheckout for each item to attempt to calculate change (using copies of values and can't modify any originals).
 * @param cash      money tendered to cashier for total purchase (all items)
 * @param price     purchase price of current item
 * @param total     running (accumulation) total of all items purchased
 * @param change    change after purchase of all items
 *
 *      public double Checkout(Cart myCart, Item myItem);
 *      to show PASS BY REFERENCE:
 *      call checkout for each item to accumulate total (in Cart object) and calculate change (in Cart object)
 *      using supplied Item object (for price) and Cart object (for total and change in Cart object for accumulation in Cart object).
 * @param myCart    shopping cart with accumulating totals
 * @param myItem    Item object to checkout
 * @return      change due to customer after payment
 *
 *      public String toString();
 *  toString() will return a String represenetation of the Cart object state.
